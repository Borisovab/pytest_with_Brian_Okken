<!-- Test discovery refers to how pytest finds your test code and depends on naming: -->
(pytest test_two.py)

    – Test files should be named test_<something>.py or <something>_test.py. 
    – Test methods and functions should be named test_<something>.
    – Test classes should be named Test<Something>.


<!-- The -v or --verbose  -->
    command-line flag is used to reveal more verbose output.

<!-- The --tb=no -->
    command-line flag is used to to turn off tracebacks.
